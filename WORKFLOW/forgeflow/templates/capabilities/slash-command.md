<!-- TEMPLATE — How to use (FRAMEWORK.md §C11.1):
  A Claude slash command is a quick, repeatable action. Like a skill but simpler (no bundled files).
  Place at:
    .claude/commands/<name>.md       (project, shared via git)  → invoked as /<name>
    ~/.claude/commands/<name>.md      (personal, all projects)
  Subdirectories namespace it: .claude/commands/release/ship.md → /release:ship
  Codex note: repo-defined custom slash commands are not the shared workflow surface. For Codex,
  create `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and point it to the same `runbooks/<name>.md`.
  Substitutions in the body: $ARGUMENTS (all args), $1 $2 $3 (positional), $name (from `arguments`).
  !`cmd` injects shell output before the model runs; @path injects a file's contents.
  Replace <PLACEHOLDER>s and delete this comment. -->
