<!-- TEMPLATE — How to use:
  The durable batch deliverable (FRAMEWORK.md move Plan & Slice (A4), taxonomy C10). THE batch file IS the deliverable —
  not a thin status table plus notes elsewhere. Every item gets a full compiled section here before the
  batch closes. The completion gate at the bottom is what makes a batch "closed". Delete this comment when
  done. -->
